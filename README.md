# Neuroimaging Method Series Example Analyses

This repository contains a growing, and actively updated set of examples for performing population based neuroimaging style ML experiments on an open access set of datasets: [AOIMIC](https://nilab-uva.github.io/AOMIC.github.io/). 

The examples provided here will be focused around performing ML based analyses and additional pre-processing steps with the python libraries [BPt](https://github.com/sahahn/BPt) and [neurotools](https://github.com/sahahn/neurotools) (libraries by the author of this example), as well as making use of a number of other important python libraries, including but not limited to [nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/index.html), [nibabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and others.
